# machine_learning_football_predictions
Experimentation with ML models to see if the outcome of a football (soccer) matches can be predicted accurately using historic data.

Please feel free to use / replicate my code as you please for your own models. 
I am happy to discuss any concepts and welcome any advice / contributions.

Please note: I have little football domain knowledge and I my experiments are only an attempt at proving to my brother that any potential statistical edges can be exposed using machine learning. 
These models are not intended for betting use and I assume no responsibility for their misuse.
